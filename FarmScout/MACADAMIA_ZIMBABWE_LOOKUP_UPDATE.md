## Regional Relevance for Zimbabwe

### Climate Considerations
Zimbabwe's subtropical highland climate (altitude 1,200-1,800m) is ideal for macadamia cultivation, but creates specific challenges:

#### Fungal Diseases
- **High humidity** during rainy season (Nov-Mar) promotes fungal infections
- **Anthracnose** and **Husk Spot** are major concerns during wet periods
- **Phytophthora** thrives in poorly drained soils common in some regions

#### Pest Pressure
- **Wildlife interactions** are significant due to Zimbabwe's abundant fauna
- **Primate damage** from vervet monkeys and baboons is a major concern
- **Elephant damage** can be severe in areas near game reserves
- **Seasonal insect pressure** varies with rainfall patterns

### Economic Impact
Macadamias are a high-value export crop for Zimbabwe, making pest and disease management critical for:
- **Export quality standards**
- **Yield optimization**
- **Tree longevity and productivity**
- **Foreign currency earnings**
